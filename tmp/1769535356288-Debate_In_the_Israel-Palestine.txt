### Debate: In the Israel-Palestine Conflict, Global Justice Demands That the World Stands with Palestine and Not Israel

To address your request, I'll simulate a structured debate on this motion. The motion posits that global justice requires exclusive support for Palestine over Israel—implying a one-sided stance against Israel. Since you specified "opposing the motion," I'll emphasize the opposition's arguments, but for a complete debate, I'll include both sides with opening statements, key points, rebuttals, and closing remarks. This draws from historical context, international law, and current perspectives (as of November 22, 2025), promoting a truth-seeking, non-partisan view.

The debate features:
- **Proposition (For the Motion)**: Argues that justice demands standing with Palestine due to systemic oppression and violations by Israel.
- **Opposition (Against the Motion)**: Argues that justice does not demand exclusive support for Palestine; instead, it requires balance, recognition of Israel's rights, and accountability on both sides to achieve peace.

#### Moderator's Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this debate on the motion: "In the Israel-Palestine conflict, global justice demands that the world stands with Palestine and not Israel." The proposition will argue for exclusive global alignment with Palestine, while the opposition will counter that justice calls for a more nuanced approach, not one-sided condemnation of Israel. Each side has time for an opening, main arguments, rebuttals, and a close. Let's begin.

#### Proposition Opening Statement (For the Motion)
Global justice is about uplifting the oppressed and holding colonizers accountable. In this conflict, Palestinians have endured decades of displacement, occupation, and violence under Israeli control. From the 1948 Nakba expelling over 700,000 Palestinians to the ongoing blockade of Gaza and illegal settlements in the West Bank, Israel has systematically violated international law. Standing with Palestine means enforcing UN resolutions, ending apartheid-like policies, and recognizing the right to self-determination. Supporting Israel perpetuates injustice—why else has the ICJ ruled the occupation illegal and ordered Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza? The world must choose: justice for the colonized, not the colonizer.

#### Opposition Opening Statement (Against the Motion)
The motion's binary framing ignores the conflict's complexity and shared responsibilities. Global justice demands impartiality, not picking sides in a dispute where both peoples have legitimate claims to the land and have suffered immensely. Israel's existence as a Jewish homeland post-Holocaust is rooted in historical justice, and its actions are often defensive against existential threats like Hamas terrorism. Exclusive support for Palestine overlooks Palestinian rejectionism, internal divisions, and acts of violence that undermine peace. True justice, per international principles, requires a two-state solution with security for both—not vilifying Israel while excusing Hamas. We oppose the motion because one-sided stances fuel endless conflict, not resolution.

#### Proposition Main Arguments (For the Motion)
1. **Historical Injustice and Colonialism**: Israel's founding displaced Palestinians in the Nakba, and ongoing settlements (over 700,000 Israelis in occupied territories) fragment Palestinian land, violating UN Resolution 242's "land for peace." Justice demands recognizing this as settler-colonialism, not equal claims.
   
2. **Apartheid and Human Rights Violations**: Reports from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International describe Israel's system as apartheid, with unequal rights, forced evictions, and Gaza's blockade creating an "open-air prison." Over 44,000 Palestinian deaths since October 2023 highlight disproportionate violence—global justice means BDS and ICJ enforcement against Israel.

3. **International Law and Double Standards**: The ICJ's 2024 opinion deems the occupation illegal, urging withdrawal. Western aid to Israel ($17.9B in 2024) enables impunity, while Palestinians face sanctions. Standing with Palestine corrects this bias for true equity.

4. **Path to Peace**: A free Palestine upholds self-determination; supporting Israel rewards aggression. Global solidarity, as in recognitions by 145 UN states, is justice in action.

#### Opposition Main Arguments (Against the Motion)
1. **Historical Legitimacy and Shared Rights**: Jews have ancient ties to the land, and Israel's 1948 creation via UN Partition was legitimate—Arabs rejected it, leading to war. The motion ignores Jewish displacement (850,000 from Arab countries post-1948) and frames Israel as sole aggressor, undermining justice's need for mutual recognition.

2. **Self-Defense Against Terrorism**: Hamas's October 7 attack killed 1,200 Israelis and took hostages—Israel's response targets militants, not civilians, using warnings and aid facilitation. Accusations of genocide fail: Israel aids Gaza (106 trucks daily recently) and investigates transgressions. Justice demands condemning Hamas's human shields and charter calling for Israel's destruction, not exclusively blaming Israel.

3. **International Law Supports Balance**: The ICJ acknowledges Israel's self-defense rights; claims of apartheid are disputed, as 20% of Israelis are Arabs with full rights. Settlements, while controversial, stem from security needs post-1967. One-sided stances ignore Palestinian rejections of peace offers (e.g., Camp David 2000). US principles call for accountability on both sides, not exclusive alignment.

4. **Practicality and Regional Stability**: Exclusive support for Palestine divides Palestinians (Hamas vs. PA) and ignores threats from Iran/Hezbollah. Justice requires a two-state solution with demilitarization and recognition—Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, yet faced rockets. Binary views prolong suffering; balance fosters mediation by the Global South.

#### Proposition Rebuttals
The opposition's "balance" is a smokescreen for Israeli impunity—self-defense doesn't justify famine or settlements. Historical Jewish ties don't erase Palestinian indigeneity. Justice isn't neutral in oppression.

#### Opposition Rebuttals
The proposition cherry-picks violations while ignoring Palestinian incitement and failed governance. Genocide claims distort: Israel's actions target Hamas, not Palestinians. True justice rejects zero-sum games, per UN calls for mutual rights.

#### Proposition Closing
Vote for the motion: Justice sides with the powerless. Stand with Palestine to end the cycle.

#### Opposition Closing
Reject the motion: Global justice thrives on equity, not exclusion. Support peace for both peoples—balance heals, division destroys.
